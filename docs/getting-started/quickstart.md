# Quickstart

## Coze LibreChat Adapter

This adapter allows the Coze low-code agent platform to be used as a custom API in the LibreChat chat application.

It sets up an Express server that listens for requests from LibreChat and forwards them to the Coze API. It translates the OpenAI-compatible API requests to the Coze API requests and vice versa.

The simplest setup is to integrate it with an existing LibreChat Docker Compose setup and is recommended.

### Installation

1. Copy the contents of the `coze_adapter` folder into the root of your LibreChat installation.
2. Add the environment variables to your LibreChat `.env` file as shown in the `example_env_additions` file.
3. Add the Coze Adapter to your LibreChat `librechat.yaml` file as shown in the `example_librechat_yaml_additions.yaml` file.
4. Add the Coze Adapter to your Docker Override File `docker-compose.override.yml` as shown in the `example_docker_override_additions.yml` file.
5.  Build and run the Coze Adapter:

    #### Using Docker (recommended)

    Navigate to the coze\_adapter folder:

    ```
    cd coze_adapter
    ```

    Build the Coze Adapter Docker image:

    ```
    sh run_docker_build_coze_adapter.sh
    ```

    or

    ```
    docker compose build coze_adapter
    ```

    Then head back to your root and run your LibreChat Docker Compose as you normally would.

    #### Running Locally (without Docker)

    Navigate to the coze\_adapter folder:

    ```
    cd coze_adapter
    ```

    Install the dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    Start the Coze Adapter on port 2222 by default:

    ```
    npm run start
    ```

    or

    ```
    node coze_adapter.js
    ```

    Then run your local LibreChat server as you would normally do.

### Usage

Once installed and running, you can use the Coze Adapter as a custom API in LibreChat. Refer to the LibreChat documentation for instructions on how to configure and use custom APIs in your chat application.

### Sync a repository

GitBook also allows you to set up a bi-directional sync with an existing repository on GitHub or GitLab. Setting up Git Sync allows you and your team to write content in GitBook or in code, and never have to worry about your content becoming out of sync.
