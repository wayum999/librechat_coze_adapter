# Build a Coze Bot

To integrate a Coze Bot with the LibreChat adapter, you first need to create a bot on the Coze platform. Follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up or Log In**: Go to [Coze](https://www.coze.com/) and sign up or log in to your account.
2. **Create a New Bot**: Navigate to the bot creation section and click on "Create New Bot".
3. **Configure Bot Settings**: Set up your bot's name, description, and any specific settings required for your use case.
4. **Generate API Key**: Once your bot is set up, generate an API key. This key will be used to authenticate requests from the adapter.

Once you have a Coze bot ready to go, you can move on to the final step in the process: installing the API adapter.
